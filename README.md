   <b>Welcome to Statistics 101: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference!</b>
   <br>
   <br>
   <b> Course Description</b>
    <br> 
   Introduction to statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis,      inference, and modeling. Focus on principles underlying quantitative research in social sciences, humanities, and public policy.        Research projects teach the process of scientific discovery and synthesis and critical evaluation of research and statistical            arguments. Readings give perspective on why in 1950, S. Wilks said, "Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a                qualification  for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write."

  <br>
  <i>As a quantitative social scientist, I am particularly excited to show you how I use data to answer questions on a variety of topics    in political science and public policy. We will also discuss how social scientists and humanists in other fields use data in their      research.</i>

   <a href="https://jacobfhsmith.github.io/mypage/">Jacob:</a> I am starting as an Assistant Research Professor in the Stats Department    as of July 1st. Previously I was a Lecturing Fellow in the Thompson Writing Program here at Duke and before that completed a Ph.D. in    Political Science at UNC-Chapel Hill. I enjoy using data and statistics to answer research questions on topics ranging from              the electoral effect of <a href="https://libkey.io/libraries/229/articles/56283884/full-text-file?utm_source=api_871">Cherie Berry's    elevator pictures</a>   to what it's like to be in the minority party in Congress. I really enjoy mentoring undergraduate student        research projects that use data to answer research questions.
