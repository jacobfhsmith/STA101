# OVERALL

Total Points: 40 points

- Ex 1: 4 points 

- Ex 2: 5 points

- Ex 3: 6 points

- Ex 4: 5 points

- Ex 5: 10 points

- Ex 6: 10 points

### Ex 1 (4 pts)
There are 7 variables and 100 observations.

- 2 points for correct number of variables

- 2 points for correct number of observations

### Ex 2 (5 pts)
You could use the n argument to specify how many observations to return. 

```{r help, eval=FALSE}
head(my_data, n = 10)
```

- 3 points for identifying the correct argument

- 2 points for using the head function with a specified n value.

### Ex 3 (6 pts)
The names of the variables in the dataset are "NC County", "Cherie Berry Percentage 2012", "Cherie Berry Votes 2012", "Population 2012", "Elevators 2012", "ElevatorsPerThousand", "Cherie_TV_2012".

- 1 point for showing how they found the names
 
- 5 points for having the correct names

### Ex 4 (5 pts)
"Population 2012" is a numeric data type. "NC County" is a charcter data type.

- 1 point for showing work

- 2 points each for correct data type

### Ex 5 (10 pts)
There are (410+29+15+26+36+50) 566 elevators in the first 6 counties in the dataset.

- 5 points for using a function to see the first 6 counties in the dataset

- 5 points for correctly using R to add the values for the number of elevators

## Ex 6 (10 pts)
Yes, there are counties where there are more than 4 elevators per thousand. There are 7 counties where this occurs.

- 5 points for correctly creating the new variable

- 5 points for correctly identifying the number of counties
